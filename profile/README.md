# Welcome to the official GitHub page of the Federal Office for Agriculture

The [Federal Office for Agriculture (FOAG)](https://www.blw.admin.ch/blw/en/home.html) is the Confederation's competence centre for all core issues relating to the agricultural sector.

The Federal Office for Agriculture is committed to ensuring sustainable agricultural production in order to contribute to food security in Switzerland. In doing so, we take into account the various interests, develop the legal basis for a progressive and effective agricultural policy and implement this policy efficiently.

The general conditions created by the federal government must allow the agricultural and food industry to enjoy market success. Innovation, efficiency, sustainability and diversity are key to this. It is equally important to use natural resources sparingly and to reduce the ecological footprint.

A multifunctional agricultural and food industry is important. We are acting now for the future.
